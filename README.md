# dotscripts -- My Xorg scripts

# Screenshot

The screenshot script can use the following backends: `deepin-screenshot`
or `maim`. You need to install at least one of them to use the script.

Then set the `BACKEND` variable accordingly in the script's source code.

## Uploading

The screenshot script supports uploading to free image hosting providers.
Currently the following upload sites are supported:
 - [Catbox](https://catbox.moe)
 - [0x0](https://0x0.st)
Imgur used to be supported, but they changed their api and I can't access the site anymore.

# Calculator

The calculator requires that you install either:
 - `bc` GNU's bc is a cli calculator
 - `qalc` A python calculator
 - `giac` By the xcas project, a full-featured CAS

Then set the `BACKEND` variable accordingly in the script's source code.
